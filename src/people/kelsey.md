Kelsey is a second year PhD student in the Modern Thought & Literature program. She is an historian of the future, and studies how the future is summoned / invoked into being as a ritual process; her work focusses on how peoples of the global south generate new effective realities (future) in the pursuit of collective liberation within the enclosed present. She's especially interested in science-fiction and speculative art. She is a textile artist working with silk fiber, traditional Mayan backstrap _weaving_ techniques, _clothing design, sewing_, and _crocheting_. She wants to take up quilting next! Ask her about sustainable and soil-to-soil textile production!
