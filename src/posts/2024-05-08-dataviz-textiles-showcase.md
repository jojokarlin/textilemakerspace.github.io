On June 5th from 12-4 PM, there will be a final showcase for the 2024 Data Visualization with Textile class, along with other recent (and not at all recent) pieces of textile art, courtesy of the campus making community and Special Collections. The showcase will take place in Hohbach Hall, in Green Library. All members of the campus community are welcome; external guests are also welcome, but will need to register at the entrance to the library.

If you're interested in contributing something to the showcase, please [fill out this form by June 3](https://forms.gle/suw3jYJPgFQjWsvC9).

For questions, please contact Quinn Dombrowski, qad@stanford.edu.
