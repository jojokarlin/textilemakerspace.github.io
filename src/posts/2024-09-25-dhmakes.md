This post is by [**Amanda**](https://bsky.app/profile/literaturegeek.bsky.social), [**Claudia**](https://bsky.app/profile/claudiaeberger.bsky.social), and [**Quinn**](https://bsky.app/profile/quinnanya.me)-- a few of the many #DHmakes community members, who've described the community in a couple places. We're gathering those descriptions into one post (though a hashtag in use across multiple platforms is defined by its users, so we aren't the authority, and its use will evolve over time!).

1.  **DH** = digital humanities (folks using or building digital tools like websites, code, VR to explore humanities areas like culture, history, art, ethics; folks using those kinds of humanities approaches to critique technology)

2.  **Makes** = craft, making, makerspace types of creative work

We published a peer-reviewed article in the *Korean Journal of Digital Humanities*,["#DHmakes: Baking Craft into DH Discourse"](https://accesson.kr/kjdh/v.1/1/73/43507), if you want to know a lot about the community's origins, history, and outputs.

## If you want a ✨tl;dr✨ though, here's a FAQ!

### Who started this?
We're digital humanities people who incorporate physical making/art into our work (or do it as a hobby and share it online somewhere)!

### Who is this for? 
#DHmakes is loosely folks in digital humanities/libraries/academia/learning-work who craft/make (including as non-job hobby), open to anyone interested. 

### What kinds of things get posted?
- "I made/am making a thing!"
- work related to including craft/textile work in making
- works-in-progress, fails, public figuring-out how to do some method/project
- explicitly celebrating, amplifying, encouraging neat craft/make work, whether or not the creators are digital humanities people 
- encouraging sharing "this is my hobby, not my job" crafts 
- getting started

### What kinds of making/crafting?

All of them? We're interested in an expansive definition and especially things that have sometimes gotten left out of how people think of makerspaces/making, such as textile art. Other frequent areas of interest tagged #DHmakes include craft/making work related to:

- history
- culture & pop culture
- zines
- data visualization & embodiment, including personal data 
- queer/feminist/critical tech, social justice
- play with historical craft practices
- expansive definitions of making that assert awesomeness of areas like fabric arts, cooking, fashion\

For examples, check out Quinn's [Textile Makerspace](https://textilemakerspace.stanford.edu/), Claudia's and Gabby Evergreen's "[Pockets of Information](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/9f1d23f02fa8483f884c1b6d20bf0762)", Jacqueline Wernimont's "[Visualizing Energy Data or Visceralizing Energy Transitions](https://jwernimont.com/visualizing-energy-data-or-visceralizing-energy-transitions/)", and Amanda's [Scholars' Lab "expansive makerspace"-tagged posts page](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/tags/expansive-makerspace).

### Why have I been tagged #DHmakes?
Folks RT/repost cool, relevant craft/making work with the tag so others get to admire them too.

### Am I "DH enough" to use the hashtag?
The "DH" in #DHmakes is digital humanities. We're guessing the other most active hashtag users agree with us: anyone curious about DH (not necessarily "experienced" or in a "DH job") should participate! Workers, students, hobbyists in areas like gallery/library/archive/museum/learning that are DH or feel adjacent too.

### Have you done things beyond using a hashtag?

Yes!
