<h2>Why a Textile Makerspace in the DLCL?</h2>

The Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages has a long history of
supporting diverse, innovative digital humanities scholarship. Over the last
decade, connections have strengthened between digital humanities and the maker
movement, with several DH labs building out makerspaces and fostering
communities around critical making praxis, data physicalization, and breathing
new life into legacy technologies. From the Incan method of recording data using
*quipu* strings and knots, to Belgian knitter-spies recording troop movements in
WWI, textiles have a long history of entanglement with language and culture that
merit exploration and cultivation, especially in a time when many people are
looking to make something "real" as a break from the ever-present digital. At
the Textile Makerspace, we teach methods for creating and using textiles and
fibers, as well as how to incorporate data into textile praxis. But it's not
primarily a research lab: the Textile Makerspace is a place where anyone is
invited to explore these tools and methods in a hands-on way, whether or not
their curiosity is connected to their academic work. We believe that stepping
away from academic work is important and necessary, and we welcome everyone to
come take a break and make something -- or just practice a new skill. Wondering
how all this came to be? Read more about how the Textile Makerspace came to be
and evolved over time on the
