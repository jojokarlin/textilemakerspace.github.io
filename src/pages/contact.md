Want to share your textile passion with others? The Textile Makerspace welcomes volunteer workshop instructors. We are also happy to arrange times for classes, labs, and groups on campus to come make things.

If you have fabric, yarn, or other textile supplies that you've realized you'll never use and would like to see them be put to use, please let us know! We gratefully accept donations.

Email Quinn Dombrowski (qad@stanford.edu) with all inquiries. You can also join our <a href="https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/textilemakerspace">mailing list with news, events, and updates</a>, and/or <a href="https://instagram.com/textilemakerspace">follow us on Instagram</a>!
