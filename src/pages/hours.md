The Textile Makerspace is run by a mix of volunteers and student staff. We'll be back to having regularly-scheduled weekday afternoon/evening hours at the start of the school year!

## Hours

To confirm the Makerspace is open, or if the door to Pigott Hall is locked, call 650-736-3626, which will ring at the Makerspace.

- Thursday, September 21: 5-7 PM

_possibly more hours to come this week, normal-ish schedule begins next week_
