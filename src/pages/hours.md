The Textile Makerspace is run by a mix of volunteers and student staff, and sometimes we have to change our hours last minute. Thanks in advance for your flexibility!

## Hours

To confirm the Makerspace is open, or if the door to Pigott Hall is locked, call 650-736-3626, which will ring at the Makerspace.

**NOTE: The embroidery machine is currently broken. We will post an update when it is fixed.**
