The Textile Makerspace is run by a mix of volunteers and student staff. The schedule can vary, but we try to keep the latest info about our open hours on this page and update it frequently.

**We're on hiatus until mid August!**

Looking forward to seeing you again then! We've now got funding for student staff all next academic year.
