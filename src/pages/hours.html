The Textile Makerspace is run by a mix of volunteers and student staff, and
sometimes we have to change our hours last minute. Thanks in advance for your
flexibility!

<h2>Hours</h2>

If you can't get into the building during the Makerspace's hours, you can call
our number for someone to let you in: 650-736-3626
<br />
Hours for finals week are 12-6 PM, Mon-Thursday. We'll be posting summer hours
soon!
