The Textile Makerspace is run by a mix of volunteers and student staff, and
sometimes we have to change our hours last minute. Thanks in advance for your
flexibility!

<h2>Hours</h2>

<p>Week of 7/1: we're open Monday/Wednesday 1-5 PM. More hours coming after the 4th of July!</p>


If you can't get into the building during the Makerspace's hours, you can call
our number for someone to let you in: 650-736-3626
