Yo, I'm an early computerized knitting machine with a bunch of rad built-in patterns from the late 1980's. Choose your design, scale it, and then I'll automatically pop out the right needles for each row as you knit.

## Supplies

I like very thin yarn, especially on cones. If the yarn isn't flowing freely and evenly, I might jam.

## Fun facts

I'm the Japanese model, so we used the label maker to put subtitles on me for all my buttons and dials.
