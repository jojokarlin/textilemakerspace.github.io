text: "I'm got several experiments going toward including non-book 'reads'/scholarship in the same visibility, amplification, browsability, and community building efforts as print book collections/displays.

E.g. DH projects, blog posts, games, zines, etc., as part of @scholarslab's larger working library. 

For our group's #ACH2023 session, I finished one of these prototypes!
